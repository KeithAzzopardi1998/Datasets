1. Introduction

This repository contains Jargo datasets. A Jargo "dataset" consists of three
files: the road network (*.rnet), the g-tree for the road network (*.gtree),
and the problem (*.instance) file. Datasets are organized by road network.

IMPORTANT: g-trees are not provided due to filesize. You can obtain a g-tree
using the C++ gtree-builder program (https://github.com/jamjpan/GTree) or by
sending me an email and I will send you the g-tree. These "g-tree" files are
used by Jargo to quickly compute shortest paths through the network.

These instances were generated by sampling all on-demand taxi requests (not
necessarily ridesharing requests) on the respective road networks, with
sampling starting at the time indicated by the `Ref' column and lasting for the
duration listed under `Duration'. The pick-up and drop-off locations for each
request were then mapped to the nearest vertex on the road network.

2. Data Formats

  2.1 Problems

  Each problem instance contains 5 tab-delimited columns. Column 1 is a unique
  identifier. Column 2 is the origin vertex. Column 3 is the destination vertex.
  Vertex 0 is a dummy vertex indicating no destination. Column 4 is the load. A
  positive load represents a seating requirement while a negative load represents
  a seating capacity. Column 5 indicates the time of appearance.

  2.2 Road Networks

  An *.rnet file is a space-delimited file listing all the edges in a road
  network, along with coordinates of the vertices. The first column is the edge
  identifier. The second and third columns are the 'from' and 'to' vertices of
  the edge. The fourth and fifth columns are the longitude (x-coordinate) and
  latitude (y-coordinate) of the 'from' vertex. The sixth and seventh columns are
  the longitude and latitude of the 'to' vertex.

  An *.edges file is provided listing each edge and its weight. This file is
  used only for building a g-tree.

  IMPORTANT: Take care that the vertices in the *.edges file are 0-indexed
  while the vertices in the *.rnet file are 1-indexed.  You can use the C++
  gtree-builder program (https://github.com/jamjpan/GTree) to build a g-tree.
