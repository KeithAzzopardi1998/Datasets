Notes

- Datasets are organized by road network
- You must obtain a G-tree for each road network you want to use with Jargo
  - Option 1: go to https://github.com/jamjpan/GTree for how to build a G-tree
  - Option 2: send me an email and I will send you the G-tree
- Sizes:
    Road        G-tree   #edges #vertices
